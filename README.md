# Comic Book Artists

Imagine that you're new to comics or even, you're in a postion in 
which you want to learn more about subject. Well that is the aim of this 
"comic website". To kick start things the first subject/comic artist of choice will be 
Stan Lee since he is the most well know comic book artist by far. 
The site will feature a picture of Stan Lee along with a minor 
introducution summary focusing on him. There will also be a page with a list of characters 
that Stan Lee is responsible for making which will also contain minor character 
summaries so the user is able to learn more about those characters. After the character
list page will come a reading reccomendations page as well as a contact page because as stated previously, 
this site will grow to be incorporate a number of comic book artists and their feats.
The contact page will allow users to send email requests of different comic book artists they would like to see on the site.
 
## UX
 
This website is people new to comics as well as people who have been apart of the community for some time.
The wedsite's main goal is to make it easier for first time users to find out information about comic book 
artists and for returning users to easily do the same. In order to do this there are links at the top of the page that take users to 1 of 4 pages that give background info and insight
on comic book artists and their work as well as reading recommendations. The process is straightforward and easy for anybody to understand with a little added design flare to make it unique.


- As a new user, I want to be able to access all comic book artist information on one site, so that I can easily research and learn about the culture of comics.
- As a general user, I want to be able to navigate the website easily so that I can access all of the site's features.
- As a returning or new user, I want to be able to submit comic artists for possible additions to the site so that I can read more about them.
- As a general user, I want to be able to use links to take me to different comics so that I can dive deeper into the works of an artist or comic characters.

## Testing


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Navigation:
    1. Open browser
    2. Click on each tab to be sure that they send the user to the desired section of the website.
    3. Opened browser on phone as well.
    4. Used each tab on phone to ensure that they sent the user to desired section of the website.


2. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

3. Reading:
    1. Go to "Reading" page
    2. Used all the links to ensure they sent user to expected page while also keeping a tab open for original website.


This websites works and functions the same on any device by using the navigation bar to move 
through the site, clicking on links to send the user to reading reccomendations, and submitting 
ideas to add to the site on the "Contact" page.
